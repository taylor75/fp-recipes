fp-recipes
==========

Random collection of functional programming exercises and recipes.

Currently, this project is structured as a repository of things I thought to try
while reading Runar's Functional Programming in Scala MEAP.  While working on those
exercises, I was also curious about how they could be implemented in scalaz.  So I 
also have included tests with scalaz 6.0.4.
